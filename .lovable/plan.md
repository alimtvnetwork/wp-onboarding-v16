# Plan: Doc Updates + Three New Code Style Rules + PHP Enforcement

## ✅ COMPLETED — Part A: Spec/Doc Files — Rename PathUtils to PathHelper

All 12+ doc/spec files updated: `RiseupPathUtils` → `PathHelper`, `CleanerUtilsTrait` → `CleanerHelperTrait`, `RestoreUtilsTrait` → `RestoreHelperTrait`.

## ✅ COMPLETED — Part B: Three New/Updated Code Style Rules

- **B1**: Rule 4 updated to include `throw` alongside `return`
- **B2**: Rule 8 added — No leading backslash on `Throwable`
- **B3**: Rule 9 added — Multi-line parameters when >2 params with trailing comma

All three rules added to `spec/01-coding-guidelines/code-style.md` and cross-referenced in PHP specs.

## ✅ COMPLETED — Part C: PHP Code Enforcement

All three sub-tasks fully enforced across ~70 PHP files in `riseup-asia-uploader` as of 2026-02-16:

- **C1**: `\Throwable`, `\PDO`, `\PDOException`, `\WP_Error` → unqualified with `use` imports
- **C2**: All functions with >2 params reformatted to one-per-line with trailing comma
- **C3**: Blank line before `return`/`throw` enforced in all multi-statement blocks

Additionally: `!PathHelper::dirExists()` → `PathHelper::isDirMissing()` and `!PathHelper::isSafePath()` → `PathHelper::isPathMissing()` guard conversions applied.

`plugins-onboard` confirmed out of scope per companion-plugin-scope.md.
